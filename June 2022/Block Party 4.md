The taxicab distance is defined as |y2 - y1| + |x2 - x1| where the first point is (x1, y1) and the second point is (x2, y2). Basically, it is the sum of the vertical and horizontal distance from one point to another.

Because all the distances are easily calculatable and all positive integers, this problem can be done by hand relatively easily. Although, this could be solved using programming as well.
